      <h1>Welcome to the Moderator Training</h1>
      <p>
        Being a moderator can be a sizeable undertaking, and there are many
        nuances for how to best moderate a community. This webpage will walk you
        through some scenarios to help you understand how to handle different
        situations. The examples provided are intended to give a general idea
        for improving your moderation skills, but they are not the holy grail.
        If you are unsure of how to tackle a specific incident, do not hesitate
        to reach out to a fellow moderator for guidance or feedback. We are a
        team, and we are all here to support each other.
