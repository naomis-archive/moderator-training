        The user's intent was neither malicious nor an intentional violation of
        the code of conduct, so a friendly reminder to everyone is sufficient.
        However, the message should be left alone as it does not contain
        inappropriate content or spam links. Leaving the message present serves
        as a historical record, and messages should only be deleted under
        specific circumstances.
