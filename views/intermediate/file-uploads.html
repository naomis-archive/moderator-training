        Even though you are a moderator, your safety is still important! To
        ensure the safety of the community as a whole, we do not allow the
        direct uploading of code files. We cannot be sure that a file is safe
        without downloading it, and the risk is not worth it. The safest option
        is to disallow file uploads entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, a user uploading a file does not have malicious intentions
        and is not trying to violate a rule - so a friendly public reminder is
        often sufficient. As a note, a file named "message.txt" is often an
        automatic file conversion done by Discord - any message over the 2000
        character limit gets converted. Keep this in mind with handling these
        situations.

      <h1>Handling File Uploads</h1>
      <p>
        A user is requesting help with their code. Here is how the conversation
        plays out:
      </p>
      <div class="chatbox">
        <pre>
      
          User: Hey, I'm having trouble with this event listener.
          You: I can probably help with that. Can you share your code?
          User: Sure thing!
          </pre
        >
      </div>
      <p>
        The user then uploads an index.js file directly to the chat. What should
        you do?
      </p>
      <p class="answer" id="a" onclick="highlight('a')">
        A: Download the file to confirm the code is safe. Delete it if not.
      </p>
      <p class="answer" id="b" onclick="highlight('b')">
        B: Download the file and help the user debug the issue.
      </p>
      <p class="answer" id="c" onclick="highlight('c')">
        C: Delete the file, then send a message to the channel reminding
        everyone not to upload files but use CodePen or GitHub Gists.
      </p>
      <p class="answer" id="d" onclick="highlight('d')">
        D: Delete the file, then send a private message to the user reminding
        them not to upload files but use CodePen or GitHub Gists.
      </p>
      <button onclick="showAnswer()">Check your answer!</button>
