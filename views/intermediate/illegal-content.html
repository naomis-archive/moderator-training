        This type of violation is severe enough to warrant an immediate ban. Do
        <em>not</em> interact with the user and do <em>not</em> provide the Code
        of Conduct. Ban the user and delete the message.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, you <em>never</em> want to save a screenshot of something
        like this. Even if it is solely for evidence purposes, having the
        content on your machine can land you in some serious trouble. Instead,
        copy the message link from Discord before you delete it, and provide
        that link to raisedadead, bjorno, and Quincy so they can reach out to the Discord
        team for support.
