# Moderator Training

This app serves as a proof of concept for a training module for [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) community moderators. The app itself is not affiliated with freeCodeCamp in any capacity.

## Contributing Content

To propose a new scenario (or module) follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a branch (it is always important to keep your master branch clean!)
3. Copy the `question.html` file into the appropriate category folder under `views` and rename it to your scenario topic. This template is already set up to link to the `CSS` and `JS` files, so all you need to do is write the content!
4. Add a link to the new file on the `index.html` under the appropriate category.
5. Push your changes to your new branch.
6. Open a PR to merge your changes with the `master` branch of this repository!

Please review our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
